## Implementation Rules

- Implement autonomously — follow existing codebase patterns, never delegate implementation to the user
- When unsure which approach fits best → present concrete options with trade-offs
- No magic strings — use constants

## Quality Gates

- No silent failures — handle errors explicitly, use early returns

## Security

- Never share `.env` file contents — if you need information, ask for the specific variable
- Review changes to `memory/`, `skills/`, and context files in PRs — these influence agent behavior and can be attack vectors (context poisoning)

## Context Hygiene

- Never add information discoverable from source code — it wastes context and reduces performance (ETH Zurich, 2026)
- Place critical constraints at the beginning of context files — models lose accuracy in the middle (Chroma, 2025)
- Prefer concrete rules over general principles — LLMs already know KISS/YAGNI/DRY/SOLID
- Knowledge compounds — integrate new facts into existing entries; don't append raw notes that may contradict existing content
- Review memory files periodically — stale context actively misleads (read `memory-review-prompt.md`)
