// one config dir per spawner and per agent each time. Every one of those is an
// EvalSymlinks walk of a path that has not changed since the last read seconds
// earlier. Keyed by the raw directory string rather than by PID: attribution no
// longer looks at processes at all, and agents sharing a profile share one entry.
//
// Safe for concurrent use: the SSE loop and the HTTP read paths enrich at the
