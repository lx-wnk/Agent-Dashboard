# Agent Skills

Project-specific AI agent skills are tracked in [`skills-lock.json`](../../skills-lock.json). The skill files themselves are **not** committed — install them locally after cloning.

```bash
# Claude Code
cat skills-lock.json | jq -r '.skills[] | "\(.source) .claude/skills/\(.name)/SKILL.md"' | while read url dest; do
  mkdir -p "$(dirname "$dest")" && curl -sL "$url" -o "$dest"
done

# Other agents (Copilot, Cursor, etc.)
cat skills-lock.json | jq -r '.skills[] | "\(.source) .agents/skills/\(.name)/SKILL.md"' | while read url dest; do
  mkdir -p "$(dirname "$dest")" && curl -sL "$url" -o "$dest"
done
```
